# Chenzo's First Node.JS and ExpressJS server

*I did the tutorials, now lets just jump in to the deep end*

The intial steps were:


```bash
$ mkdir nodeserver
$ cd nodeserver
$ npm init
$ npm install express --save
```

To run it, navigate to the nodeserver directory and then:

```bash
$ screen
$ node server.js
```

This sets it in a _screen session_. The terminal can be closed. To get back to that _screen session_ just type this:

```bash
$ screen -r
```

You'll be recoonected to the backgrounded sheel.
